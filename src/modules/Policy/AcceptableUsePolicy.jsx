            <p>Last updated: January 9, 2020</p>
            <p>
                VCNC is a place to build and grow a healthy Vietnamese
                professional network. We believe if people don’t feel safe they
                can’t contribute to knowledge or listen to another person’s
                point of view. The following rules help everyone on VCNC have a
                safe experience
            </p>
            <h4>Be Nice, Be Respectful</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Engage with Others in a Constructive Way</b>
            </p>
            Assume everyone on VCNC is here to make the platform a great
            resource with diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and opinions. It is OK
            to disagree, but please be civil, respectful, and considerate to
            other posters.
            <p>
                <b>No Hate Speech</b>
            </p>
            VCNC is a place for civil discourse and does not tolerate content
            that attacks or disparages an individual or group based on race,
            gender, religion, nationality, ethnicity, political group, sexual
            orientation or another similar characteristic. Any generalizations
            about these topics should be phrased as neutrally as possible.
            <p>
                <b>No Harassment and Bullying</b>
            </p>
            Abusive behavior directed towards private individuals is not
            allowed. Repeated and unwanted contact constitutes a form of
            harassment. Content should not make threats against others or
            advocate violence, including self-harm.
            <h4>Respect the Rights of Others</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Identity and Deceptive Activity</b>
            </p>
            Your VCNC profile should use your real name or legally incorporated
            business name and use accurate and truthful credentials. Do not use
            VCNC to impersonate another person, act as another entity without
            authorization, or create multiple accounts.
            <p>
                <b>Intellectual Property and Personal Rights</b>
            </p>
            Do not post content that infringes any intellectual property or
            personal right of another party. Writing taken from another source
            should be properly attributed and block quoted.
            <h4>Respect the VCNC Platform</h4>
            <p>
                <b>No Spam</b>
            </p>
            Do not use VCNC to post or attract spam.
            <p>
                <b>No Malicious or Illegal Activity</b>
            </p>
            Do not contribute viruses, malware, and other malicious programs or
            engage in an activity that harms or interferes with the operation of
            VCNC or seeks to circumvent security or authentication measures. Do
            not use VCNC to engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or to
            promote illegal acts.
            <p>
                <b>Abide by Other VCNC Policies</b>
            </p>
            Follow VCNC's other policies, which VCNC may add or change from time
            to time.
