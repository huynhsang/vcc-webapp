                At VCNC, we expect our users to respect the intellectual
                property rights of others. All capitalized terms used in the
                VCNC Copyright Policy have the same meaning as defined in the
                VCNC Terms of Service, which incorporates this policy by
                reference into its terms.
            </p>
            <h4>Discouragement of Copyright Infringement</h4>
            <p>
                We ask users of VCNC to take care to avoid infringing copyrights
                of others. If you infringe copyrights of others, Your Content
                may be removed or suspended in whole or part. It is our policy,
                in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, to disable
                and/or terminate accounts of users who repeatedly infringe or
                are charged repeatedly with infringing the copyrights or other
                intellectual property rights of others.
            </p>
            In order to provide us a complaint notice, you should:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide your contact information, including your mailing

                    Identify the copyrighted work that you claim has been
                    infringed. You may provide a representative list of the
                    copyrighted works that you claim have been infringed.

                    requesting to be removed or disabled. (For example, by
                    providing each URL where the material may be found on the
                    Quora Platform.)

                            disputed use of the copyrighted material or
                            reference link to such material is not authorized by
                            the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (e.g., as

            <h4>If There Is a Copyright Complaint Against You</h4>
            <p>
                If you receive a notice that a posting or portion of Your
                Content has been removed or suspended due to a copyright
                complaint, that means that we removed it at the request of a
                content owner. If you believe the material was removed in error,
                you have the option to file a counter-notification. When we
                receive a proper counter-notification, we will forward it to the
                party who originally complained about the alleged copyright
                violation. If we do not receive a notice from the original
                complainant within 10 business days, stating that the original
                complainant is seeking a court order to prevent further
                infringement of the content at issue, we will clear the
                complaint from your account’s record, and, at our discretion, we
                may replace the content that was removed.
            </p>
            <h4>How to File a Counter Notification</h4>A proper counter
            notification should be sent to VCNC’s Copyright Agent, as provided
            above, and it should contain the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Your name, address, and telephone number</li>
                <li>
                    The URLs of the content that was removed or disabled by us
                    (you can copy and paste the link provided in the
                    notification email)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The following statements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I consent to the jurisdiction of judicial district
                            in which VCNC Inc. is located. I will accept service
                            of process from the claimant of copyright
                            infringement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I declare, under penalty of perjury, that I have a
                            good faith belief that the content was removed as a
                            result of a mistake or misidentification of the
                            material to be removed or disabled.
