                    You agree to release, indemnify, defend VCNC Entities from
                    all third-party claims and costs (including reasonable

                    of the VCNC Platform, ii) Your Content, iii) your conduct or
                    interactions with other users of the VCNC Platform, or iv)
                    your breach of any part of this Agreement. We will promptly
                    notify you of any such claim and will provide you (at your
                    expense) with reasonable assistance in defending the claim.
                    You will allow us to participate in the defense and will not
                    settle any such claim without our prior written consent. We
                    reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the
                    exclusive defense of any matter otherwise subject to
                    indemnification by you. In that event, you will have no
                    further obligation to defend us in that matter.

                    without regard to or application of its conflict of law

                            manner of notification could include, for example,
                            via email, posted a notice on the VCNC Platform, or
                            other manner.. Your failure to cancel your account,

                            notification of the amendment, will constitute your

                            brought in city court in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
