            <h3>Trademark Policy</h3>
            <p>Last Updated: January 7, 2020</p>
            <p>
                At VCNC, we expect our users to respect the intellectual
                property rights of others. All capitalized terms used in the
                VCNC Trademark Policy have the same meaning as defined in the
                VCNC Terms of Service, which incorporates this policy by
                reference into its terms.
            </p>
            <h4>Discouragement of Trademark Infringement on VCNC</h4>
            Trademarks should not be used in any way that causes confusion about
            the source of goods or sponsorship. If you infringe trademarks of
            others, Your Content may be removed or suspended in whole or part.
            It is our policy, in appropriate circumstances and at our
            discretion, to disable and/or terminate accounts of users who
            repeatedly infringe or are charged repeatedly with infringing the
            trademarks or other intellectual property rights of others.
            <h4>Recourse for Trademark Owners</h4>
            If you are a trademark owner who believes your trademark has been
            infringed on VCNC, we provide a mechanism for you to notify us of
            your concerns. To help us respond appropriately, we ask you to
            provide us with the following information:
            <ul>
                Your full name and contact information, including address, phone
                number, and email contact
                <li>
                    Identification of the trademark and evidence of registration
                    rights
                </li>
                <li>Your relationship to the owner of the trademark rights</li>
                <li>
                    Reasonably identification for us (e.g., URL link) of the
                    location on the VCNC Platform where you believe infringement
                    has occurred
                </li>
                <li>
                    A short description of why you believe the use in question
                    infringes your trademark rights
                </li>
                <li>
                    Verification that all of the information in your report of
                    infringement is accurate; that you have a good faith belief
                    that the use of the intellectual property, described in the
                    manner you have complained about, is not authorized by the
                    rights owners, its agent, or the law; and that you are the
                    owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
                    exclusive intellectual property that allegedly is infringed
