            Choices.
            <h4>Your Choices</h4>
            You may, of course, decline to submit information through the VCNC
            Platform, in which case we may not be able to provide certain
            services to you. You may also control the types of notifications and
            communications we send, limit the information shared within the VCNC
            Platform about you, and otherwise amend certain privacy settings.
            Here is some further information about some of your choices:
            <p>
                <b>Anonymous Posts.</b> You may post certain content
                anonymously, including questions and answers. In such event,
                your name is not displayed along with the content, and VCNC does
                not associate such content with your user ID and other profile
                data. For further information see how anonymity works on VCNC.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Your Content.</b> You may edit or delete the answers that you
                post at any time. Any questions you have posted may remain on
                the VCNC Platform and be edited by other users. Any deleted
                content will be removed from third party sites from which it has
                been shared via VCNC’s standard sharing features; however we
                have no control over deletions or changes to your content if it
                has been shared manually by others. When you make edits to your
                content, other users will be able to see the history of those
                edits in your profile activity and on content edit logs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Adult Content.</b> In your profile’s privacy settings, you
                can elect whether to receive adult content.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Emails and Communications.</b> When you join the VCNC
                Platform by signing up for an account or creating a profile, as
                part of the service, you will receive the VCNC digest containing
                content that we believe may match your interests. You can manage
                your email and notice preferences in your account profile
                settings, under your Emails and Notifications settings. If you
                opt out of receiving emails about recommendations or other
                information we think may interest you, we may still send you
                transactional emails about your account or any services you have
                requested or received from us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third parties may comment on your postings within the VCNC
                Platform. In your profile, under your Privacy Settings, you can
                adjust whether to allow people to comment on your answers and
                posts. You can also adjust permissions about who you allow to
                send you messages on the VCNC Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Followers.</b> You can block the ability of another VCNC user
                to follow you by selecting the setting for this in the other
                user’s profile. You can change whether or not you follow other
                users.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Topics.</b> You can change topics that you follow or that
                your profile lists as areas that you know about.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Credentials.</b> You can change your credentials that are
                displayed in your profile or in connection with a specific
                answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Indexed Search.</b> In your privacy settings, you can control
                whether your profile and name is indexed by search engines.
                Changes to privacy settings may only apply on a going-forward
                basis; for example, your name (e.g., answers and profile) that
                has already been indexed by search engines may remain indexed
                for a period of time even after you have turned off indexing, as
                implementing this change is outside of our control.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Deleted or Deactivated Account.</b> If you choose “Delete
                Account” in your profile’s “Privacy Settings,” then all of your
                content will be removed from public visibility on the VCNC
                Platform, and it may not be restored by us, even if you change
                your mind. If you choose “Deactivate Account,” then you will no
                longer receive any communications from us, and users will not be
                able to interact with you; however your content will remain on
                the VCNC Platform. Once you deactivate your account, you can
                reactivate it any time by choosing to log in.
            </p>

                tab in your profile settings, and you may access, amend and
                delete much of your profile information through your profile
                settings. Once you disconnect a Linked Network, we will not
                receive information from that Linked Network going forward
                unless you choose to reconnect it. You may also control whether
                the Linked Network is visible in your profile. Please see this

            VCNC is headquartered in the United States, and has operations,
            entities and service providers in the United States and throughout
            the world. As such, we and our service providers may transfer your
            personal information to, or access it in, jurisdictions (including
            the United States) that may not provide equivalent levels of data
            protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure
            that your personal information receives an adequate level of
            protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.
            <h4>Children’s Privacy</h4>
            We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from
            anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to
            register. If we become aware that we have collected personal
            information from a child under the relevant age without parental
            consent, we take steps to delete that information.
            <h4>Links to Other Websites</h4>
            The VCNC Platform may contain links to third-party sites or online
            services. We are not responsible for the practices of such third
            parties, whose information practices are subject to their own
            policies and procedures, not to this Privacy Policy.
